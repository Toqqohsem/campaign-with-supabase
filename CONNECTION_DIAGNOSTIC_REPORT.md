# Connection Diagnostic Report
**Generated:** 2025-10-23
**Project:** Campaign with Supabase

---

## Summary

✅ **Credentials Valid:** Your Supabase URL and API keys are correctly formatted
⚠️ **Database Access:** Cannot connect to database endpoints
✅ **Auth Endpoint:** Auth endpoint is responding
❌ **Overall Status:** Database appears to be inaccessible

---

## Test Results

### Test 1: Environment Variables
✅ **PASSED**
- VITE_SUPABASE_URL: `https://tjuroohluasvakqgnxpz.supabase.co`
- VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY: Valid JWT format
- Service Role Key: Valid JWT format

### Test 2: Network Connectivity
✅ **PARTIAL** - Base URL responds (HTTP 200/403)
- The Supabase server is reachable
- Getting HTTP 403/Access Denied on specific endpoints

### Test 3: Database Queries
❌ **FAILED** - `TypeError: fetch failed`
- Cannot query `campaigns` table
- Fails with both anon key and service role key
- Error suggests network/connectivity issue

### Test 4: Authentication Endpoint
✅ **PASSED**
- Auth check successful
- No active session (expected)
- Auth endpoint is responding properly

---

## Diagnosis

Based on the test results, the most likely cause is:

### **Your Supabase project is PAUSED**

**Why this is likely:**
1. ✅ Auth endpoint works (lightweight, always available)
2. ❌ Database queries fail (database is paused)
3. ❌ HTTP 403 "Access denied" on REST API
4. ✅ Credentials are valid (auth check succeeded)

**What happens when a project is paused:**
- Free tier Supabase projects automatically pause after 7 days of inactivity
- Auth endpoints remain accessible
- Database connections are disabled
- REST API returns "Access denied"
- You need to unpause the project in the dashboard

---

## How to Fix

### Step 1: Check Your Supabase Project Status

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/projects
2. Find your project: **tjuroohluasvakqgnxpz**
3. Look for a "Paused" indicator or banner
4. If paused, there should be a **"Restore Project"** or **"Unpause"** button

### Step 2: Unpause the Project (if paused)

1. Click the **"Restore"** or **"Unpause"** button
2. Wait 2-3 minutes for the database to start up
3. You'll see a progress indicator
4. Once complete, the project status should show "Active"

### Step 3: Verify Connection

After unpausing, run this test again:

```bash
node quick-test.js
```

You should see:
- ✅ Campaigns query successful (or error about table not existing - that's fine!)
- ✅ Auth check successful
- ✅ Service role query successful

### Step 4: Apply Migrations

Once connected, you'll need to create your database schema:

**Option A: Supabase Dashboard (Easiest)**
1. Go to: SQL Editor in your Supabase dashboard
2. Run each migration file in order:
   - `supabase/migrations/20250919125439_dark_desert.sql`
   - `supabase/migrations/20250919130305_golden_sky.sql`
   - `supabase/migrations/20250919130933_sparkling_lagoon.sql`
   - `supabase/migrations/20251007000000_add_auth_support.sql`

**Option B: Supabase CLI**
```bash
# Install CLI
npm install -g supabase

# Login
supabase login

# Link project
supabase link --project-ref tjuroohluasvakqgnxpz

# Push migrations
supabase db push
```

---

## Alternative Issues (if not paused)

If your project shows as "Active" and you're still having issues:

### Possibility 1: Project Configuration Issue

**Check:**
- Database is enabled in project settings
- Postgres is running (check project health)
- No billing issues (if applicable)

**Fix:**
- Contact Supabase support
- Check for any error messages in dashboard

### Possibility 2: Network/Firewall Issue

**Check:**
- Are you behind a corporate firewall?
- Is your VPN blocking Supabase?
- Can you access https://tjuroohluasvakqgnxpz.supabase.co from a browser?

**Fix:**
- Try from a different network
- Disable VPN temporarily
- Check firewall settings

### Possibility 3: Wrong Credentials

**Check:**
- Did you copy the keys from the correct project?
- Are the keys from the Settings → API page?
- Did you copy the full key (they're very long)?

**Fix:**
- Re-copy keys from dashboard
- Make sure you're copying from the right project
- Verify no extra spaces or line breaks

## What to Do Next

### Immediate Action: Unpause Your Project

1. Visit: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/tjuroohluasvakqgnxpz
2. Look for pause indicator
3. Click "Restore" or "Unpause"
4. Wait for startup to complete

### After Unpausing:

1. **Test connection:**
   ```bash
   node quick-test.js
   ```

2. **Apply migrations:**
   - Use Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor
   - Copy/paste each migration file
   - Run in chronological order

3. **Verify tables exist:**
   ```sql
   SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables
   WHERE table_schema = 'public';
   ```

4. **Test the application:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Try to sign up:**
   - Open http://localhost:5173
   - Create a test account
   - Try creating a campaign

## Expected Outcomes

### After Unpausing + Migrations Applied:

✅ `node quick-test.js` shows:
- Campaigns query successful (returns empty array or data)
- Auth check successful
- Service role query successful

✅ `npm run dev` shows:
- Application starts without errors
- Can access in browser
- Can sign up / log in
- Can create campaigns

✅ Database has tables:
- campaigns
- personas
- creative_assets
- ad_copy
- leads

✅ Security working:
- Users can only see their own campaigns
- RLS policies are active
- Authentication required

## Troubleshooting Commands

```bash
# Test connection
node quick-test.js

# Check .env file
cat .env

# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Check if node_modules are installed
ls node_modules/@supabase

# Re-install dependencies if needed
rm -rf node_modules && npm install
```
